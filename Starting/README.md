# Starting
An introduction into the python programming language through 10 exercises.

## Ex00: containers
Python has different types of container data types, including lists, tuples, sets, and dicts.  
Each data type is different, and is useful in its own way.

**Lists** are useful for storing dynamic data.  
**Tuples** are useful for storing Immutable data.  
**Sets** function like mathematical sets and are useful for fast data access.  
**Dictionaries** store key value pairs, and just like sets, they are also useful for fast data access.

This exercise goes into how to read and write into each data type.
