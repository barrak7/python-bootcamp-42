# Starting
An introduction into the python programming language through 10 exercises.

## Ex00: containers
Python has different types of container data types, including lists, tuples, sets, and dicts.  
Each data type is different, and is useful in its own way.

**Lists** are useful for storing dynamic data.  
**Tuples** are useful for storing Immutable data.  
**Sets** function like mathematical sets and are useful for fast data access.  
**Dictionaries** store key value pairs, and just like sets, they are also useful for fast data access.

This exercise goes into how to read and write into each data type.

## Ex01: format time
Working with time and dates is important in data science. This exercise introduces time and date modules in python and how to use and format their output.

`time` module is used to get the time in seconds since the epoch `January 9, 1970, 00:00 UTC`  
`datetime` module is used to get the date of the day.
