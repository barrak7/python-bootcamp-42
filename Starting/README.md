# Starting
An introduction into the python programming language through 10 exercises.

## Ex00: containers
Python has different types of container data types, including lists, tuples, sets, and dicts.  
Each data type is different, and is useful in its own way.

**Lists** are useful for storing dynamic data.  
**Tuples** are useful for storing Immutable data.  
**Sets** function like mathematical sets and are useful for fast data access.  
**Dictionaries** store key value pairs, and just like sets, they are also useful for fast data access.

This exercise goes into how to read and write into each data type.

## Ex01: format time
Working with time and dates is important in data science. This exercise introduces time and date modules in python and how to use and format their output.

`time` module is used to get the time in seconds since the epoch `January 9, 1970, 00:00 UTC`  
`datetime` module is used to get the date of the day.

## Ex02: find type
This exercise introduces types, type hints, and functions.  
Define a function that takes in a parameter of type `Any`, determines its type using built-in `type` function, and prints an appropriate message.

## Ex03: Null not found
Introduction to different null types in python.

`0: integer value 0`  
`'': empty string literal`  
`None: NoneType, null data type`
`nan: float value, not a number. Can happen in operation involving inf values`
`False: boolean value`

## Ex04: what is
Create a program that takes in an integer as argument, check its parity, and raise an error if the input is not appropriate.

Introduces standalone scripts with command line arguments, try-except statement, and Assert statement.

## Ex05: building
Prompting user for input, and parsing the input using built-in string functions.

## Ex06: ft_filter
An intorduction into iterators. Implement custom iterator simulating built-in `filter` function.

## Ex07: sos
Translate user input to morse code using `str.maketrans` and `str.translate`

## Ex08: ft_tqdm
Implement a clone of tqdm.  
an introduction into generators in python.
