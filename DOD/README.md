# DOD

The subject for this module states:
> "A common complaint to data scientists is that they write shitcode (by the way, only for
educational purposes you may find a lot of examples of Python shitcode [here](https://shitcode.net/latest/language/python), provided
strictly for educational purposes). Why? Because the average data scientist uses a lot of
inefficient techniques and hard coded variables and neglects object-oriented programming.
Do not be like them."

I believe this is not a truly `Data Oriented Design - DOD` module since you can't really manage memory in python, but rather it is about certain best practices of writing `clean code`
